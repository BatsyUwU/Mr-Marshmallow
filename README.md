# Mr. Marshmallow
A happy li'l marshmallow-based Discord bot! A sweet boy who'll help spice up your server. Runs on Discord.js / Node.js.

## Features
- Dab on someone!
- Quote your friends!
- Welcome new people to your server or wish them happy trails!
- Pin the best posts of your server!
- Roll for a D20!
- Play a game of trivia or solve some riddles! (currently in the works)

## Installation
Mr. Marshmallow runs on top of Node.js. Please refer to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) for installation.

Once Node.js is installed, go to the bot's main directory and type `npm install` in a terminal window; it should install all of the necessary packages for you.

It's highly recommended to keep this bot running with PM2, a Node.js process manager. In the case of an unexpected shutdown, Mr. Marshmallow will be able to get right back up when your system starts! Please refer to [this guide](https://discordjs.guide/improving-dev-environment/pm2.html#installation) on how to set up PM2.
